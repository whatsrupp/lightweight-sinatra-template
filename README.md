# Sinatra Template

This is a flyweight repository for those who want to make a quick Sinatra App but don't want to spend 30minutes setting up the file structure and don't want to be overwhelmed by the sprawling horde of rails files.

In fairness to Rails, the documentation is fantastic and it's a very powerful tool but it's just not appropriate for really basic apps.

## Usage

### Clone the repository
```
$  git clone  
```

### Link to your own repository

```

```

### Change the naming conventions to fit your needs
Throughout the app there are references to 'App', simply rename this convention if
necessary!
